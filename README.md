# class_cpp
In this project, I try to implement class in C++

## Using a class in C++ (UsingAClassC++)
In this folder you will find two .cpp files: main.cpp and gaussian.cpp. If you open main.cpp it has three parts:
- a header
- a class declaration
- a main function

### Header
We use this a lot in our C++ files such as #include <iostream>

### Class declaration
We need to declare the Class to give main function access to the Gaussian class.

### Main funciion
We can instantiate the object of Gaussian class inside the main function.
